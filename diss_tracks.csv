4-Mar-91,"""Fuck Compton""",Tim Dog,"DJ Quik, Michel'le, N.W.A, Compton, West Coast Rap, and Gangsta Rap",1991,"Oh shit mutherfuckas step to the rear and cheer
'Cause Tim Dog is here
Let's get down to the nitty gritty
And talk about a bullshit city
Talking about niggaz from Compton
They're no comp and they truly ain't stomping

Tim Dog a black man's task

I'm so bad I'll whip Superman's ass

All you suckers that rif on the West Coast

I'll dis and spray your ass like a roach

Ya think you're cool wit your curls and your shades

I'll roll thick and you'll be yelling raid

One hard brother that lives in New York

Where brothers are hard and we don't have to talk

Shut your mouth before we come out stomping

Hey, yo Eazy

Fuck Compton



(Why you dissing Eazy?)

'Cause the boy ain't shit

Chew him with tobacco, an' spit him in shit

I crush Ice Cube, I'm cool wit Ice T

But NWA ain't shit to me

Dre beating on Dee from Pump it Up

Step to the Dog and get fucked up

I'm simplistic, imperialistic, idealistic

And I'm kicking ballistics

Having that gang war

We want to know what you're fighting for

Fighting over colors?

All that gang shit is for dumb muthafuckas

But you go on thinking you're hard

Come to New York and we'll see who gets robbed

Take your jeri curls, take your black hats

Take your wack lyrics and your bullshit tracks

Now you're mad and you're thinking about stomping

Well I'm from the South Bronx

Fuck Compton



Tim Dog and I'm the best from the East

And all this Compton shit must cease

So keep your eyes on the prize and

Don't jeopardize my arrive 'cause that's not wise

You really think that you can rhyme

Well come and get some of this loaded tech-nine

Bo bo bo shots are cold gunning

And you'll really be a hundred miles and running

You wanna play go ride in a sleigh

I'm so large I fuck Michel le'

In the bathroom we was boning

You shoulda heard how the bitch was moaning

Do do do do dooo do do do do do do do

Shut the fuck up bitch, you can't sing

Ya sound like a kid playing on a swing (Fuck you)

I'm the man at hand to run the band

That's in command

You know who the fuck I am

Tim Dog, what's my muthafucking name

Tim Dog, that's my muthafucking game

So whether you think that I'm just a myth

That riff, the lift, the gift, the if, the fifth'

The shift, the spliff, that's in control, to hold

To fold, to bold and make an ache and take and fake

Wooh! and I'm still great



Fuck Compton"
1-May-91,"""Pop Goes the Weasel""",3rd Bass,Vanilla Ice,1991,"Antoine, Antoine's got something here
Ro-roll that window
We have to turn around because I want to shoot you
Park the limousine, in front of the swamp
Then I want to shoot you dauncing on the limousine
with the swamp in the background

It looks like you're in the jungle, okay?



Let's all sing, Pop Goes the Weasel!



[Pete Nice]

Pop goes the, pop goes the windin of the weasel

I see the empty pocket needs a refill



[MC Serch]

I got a squad with a list of complainers

I should have started RAPE:

Rappers Against Phony Entertainers

So we can make it known that we won't get swayed

It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change



[Pete Nice]

Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)

Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)

Why not take your top ten pop hit

fix the music and make senseless ryhmes fit



[MC Serch]

I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic

Intricate raps, becomin so simplistic

I gotta strong mind it doesn't have to be spoon-fed

And I can read what doesn't have to be read



[Pete Nice]

So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked

You go the ways of the weasel (the weasel)



[Chorus: 3rd Bass x2]



Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel [3X]

Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop



[MC Serch]

Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop

the second a record was number one on the pop charts

For those that get on heart that gotta in the ghetto

Let no one forget about the hard part

Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band

lookin like the same old Klan

Same old theives that skeez so we gotta make sure

that real rap has got to endure



[Pete Nice]

Why score all my points in one peroid

Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid

The paper for the media presence

Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend

Stop vexin on the skills, ya ain't originate

The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight

Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel

Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel



[Chorus]



[Serch] Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it

[Pete] Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it

[Serch] Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it

[Pete] But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid



[MC Serch]

Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps

to reach all four corners of the map

For kids in Kansas.. to those who speak Spanish

Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished

Can't manage the truth until you buy a way

Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway

to rest but a crook, had to take a second look

Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?

But the Minister Prime can lay laws

Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours



[Pete Nice]

Goes for mine, I goes for mine

Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine

On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody

Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody

Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?

Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin 

I got pub and I'ma nut like a SCUD see

Blowin up, like I'm throwin up a beef patty

Sell-outs run a bout like the measles

No cures, cause pop goes the weasels



[Chorus 2X]"

Why should I look at you when you

I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I don't even understand why the fuck

Why drag me down in your misery

And when you stare you don't think I feel it

But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades

Crystal meth and yeast infections

Just like you I got my vices

I got a thought that would be nice

I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice

29-Oct-91,"""No Vaseline""",Ice Cube,"former N.W.A bandmates Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella and their manager, Jerry Heller",1991,"Got damn, I'm glad ya'll set it off.
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft.
First you was down with the AK,
and now I see you on a video with Michel'le?
Lookin' like straight bozos.
I saw it comin', that's why I went solo.

And kept on stompin',

when ya'll mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton.

Livin' with the whites, one big house,

and not another nigga in site.

I started off with too much cargo,

dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough.

White man just rulin'.

The Niggas With Attitudes -- who ya foolin'?

Ya'll niggas just phony,

I put that on my mama and my dead homeys.

Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin';

Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'.

Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-a-dick;

Eazy E saw your ass and went in it quick.

You got jealous when I got my own company,

but I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me.

Tryin' to sound like Amerikkka's Most,

you could yell all day but you don't come close.

Cuz you know I'm the one that flown,

ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go.

With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and ya'll disgrace the C-P-T.

Cuz you're gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy,

with no vaseline...



[Refrain]

[L.L. sample:] ""Now you're gettin' done without vaseline..."" [3x]

[Biz Markie sample:] ""Damn, it feels good to see people...on it""



The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin',

who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?

You're gettin' fucked real quick,

and Eazy's dick, is smellin' like MC Ren's shit.

Tried to tell you a year ago,

but Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so

I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked,

now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank.

Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it

cuz the broomstick fit your ass so perfect.

Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls,

cuz I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers.

Gang-banged by your manager, fella,

gettin' money out your ass, like a mothafuckin' Ready Teller.

Givin' up the dollar bills,

now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels.

So don't believe what Ren say,

cuz he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte,

but I got a whip for ya Toby;

used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me.

It's a case of divide-and-conquer,

cuz you let a Jew break up my crew.

House nigga gotta run and hide,

yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside.

So don't front, MC Ren, cuz I remember when you drove a B 2-10.

Broke as a mothafuckin' joke.

Let you on the scene to back up the Verse Team.

It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart,

and they rippin' your asshole apart.

By takin' your green, oh yeah,

the Villain does get fucked with no vaseline.



[Refrain scratched]



I never have dinner with the President.

I never have dinner with the President.

I never have dinner with the President.

And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant.

Now I think you a snitch,

throw a house nigga in a ditch.

Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys.

You little maggot; Eazy E turned faggot.

With your manager, fella,

fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella.

But if they were smart as me,

Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree.

With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline.

Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on...

till that Jheri curl is gone.

On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation.

Heard you both got the same bank account,

dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?

Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple.

Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew

with a white Jew tellin' you what to do.

Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs.

With a midget who's a punk too,

tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you.

Eric Wright, punk, always into somethin', gettin' fucked at night.

By Mista Shitpacker, bend over for the gotdamn cracker, no vaseline..."
9-Dec-91,"""Miserablism""",Pet Shop Boys,Morrissey,1991,"It seems to me there's something serious beginning
A new approach found to the meaning of life
Deny that happiness is open as an option
And disappointment disappears over night
Say that love is an impossible dream

Face the facts, that's what it's always been

Relax, what you see is what you've seen

What you get, is a new philosophy



(That's what you got, that's what you get)

(That's what you got, that's what you get)



Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't



Meanwhile your life is still directed as a drama

With realism on the sparsest of sets

Every performance tends to reach the same conclusion

No happy endings but a message to depress

Saying life is an impossible scheme

That's the point of this philosophy



Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't



But if is wasn't, and isn't were

You can't be sure, but you might find ecstasy



(Oh no)



Just for the sake of it, make sure you're always frowning

(get get get)

It shows the world that you've got substance and depth

You know, life is an impossible scheme

And love an imperceptible dream



(That's what you got, that's what you get)

(That's what you got, that's what you get)



Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't

Miserable"

Take a tire, all these fake crooks need to retire

they gotcha gassed, takin back and snatch fire outcha

maggot ass, Havoc represent for the Q-B-C

smoke that ass like a lucie..tho I need to quit

I mention, nuthin but the real shit presentin

try for? you half-steppin

like a fresh tec out of the box

yo niggas I'm testin

(There's no question)

bitch ass have you confessin

like a D-T left in state of depression

the snitch-snatcher tookin wit asthma

Yeah likewise, Im tired of rap guys whose faggots

I baptize, niggas get wet, put up your backside

your claptized and set straight, put on your head straight

watch out for, 

these upstate cats be leary of you 

yeddy niggas wit gats plus the walls on they backs

Rikers Island flashback of the house you got scuffed it in

you would think you gettin your head shot was enough but then

Now you wanna got at my team, 

you must of been drunk when you wrote that shit

too bad you had to did it to your own self

my rebellion, I retaliate, I had the whole New York state

aimin at your face

at the gate, bottom line of top soon as you came through

shot through, don't even know the half of my crew

I got a hundred strong arm niggas ready to rock the shit

clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits

you look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches

get chppoed up, Grade A meat, somethin delicious

and laced back up, 2 G's, one for stitches

then reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again

my Mobb's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans

wit bangers the size of African spears

it's warfare in the arena, you turn arenas into house of horrors

its terrodome, when you see my click you need to run behind shit

you gotta gat you betta find it

and use that shit think fast and get reminded

of robberies in Manhattan you knew what happened

60 g's and one for gun clappin

Who Shot Ya? You'd probably scream louder than an opera

New York gotcha, now you wanna use my mob as a crutch

what makes you think you cant get bucked again

Once again, back in the house once again

You ain't made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most 



Wanted to cease from the Midwest to the East 



On the dick of the East for your 1st release 



Your lease is up at the crib house niggaz get evicted 



And videos wit white boys talking you get Wicked 



Natural Born Killa, nigga you natural born God 



Look, read listen, got the nerve to say you rob 



Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your Death Certificate 



Slanging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence 



Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October 



Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over 



Rap career is over, better off acting 



What trouble I see, you're managing WC and Wack 10 



You backed in to a four corner hustla 



Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her 



Use Higher Learning, don't take my words out of text 



Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX 



It'll take the Nation of Millions to Hold Me Back 



From giving you mouth shots or hit wit the pipe Ralph got 



When sucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good 



I wasn't salty, she was wit the Boyz N the Hood

Up on this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out 



I break in and smack niggaz that's in the Slaughterhouse 



This ain't no East coast, West coast, none of the above 



I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggaz gave me love 



There's a thin line between the fake and the real 



Grafted ass nigga, I see through your Glass Shield 



Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo 



I'm a have ta wreck a Ho'shea 



I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper 



(So what) so I had to slap her, ugn 



And violate you, a Muslim drinking brew 



Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 



I seen you, you ain't say shit to ATL 



Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell 



It out, like you sold Kam and Threat 



A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West 



Guess you knew you're shit was done plus the one got you cable 



Hoo Bangin, you ain't banging shit but the table 



And the Circle Madd, ain't got no choice but to fight 



Ain't none of y'all muthafukas got a chance on the mic 



Anytime you come out, yo, I'm a talk about you 



Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you

And who he comin through right now, Makaveli the Don

Feel this, Killuminati



(Toss it up!)

Lord have mercy, father help us all

Since you supllied yo' phone number, I can't help but call

Time for action, conversatin, we relaxin, kickin back

Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that

Tongue kissin, hand full of hair, look in my eyes

Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise

Me and you movin in the nude, do it in the living room

Sweatin up the sheets, it's the Thug in me

I mean no disrespectin when I tongue kiss your neck

I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect

Late night, hit the highway, drop the top

I pull over, gettin busy in the parking lot

And don't you love it how I lick your, hips and glide

Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside

Got ya lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust

I got the bedroom shakin back-breakin when we're tossin it up



[K-Ci, JoJo]

In this baby, I like the way it's goin down

When all that is around, slip slide ride

Givin me love nice like

Female I like, what I wanna give all night

You and me alone everybody's gone toss it up

Baby let's, get it on!

I like the way you please me, babe

The sexy way you tease me, sugar

The way you move your body

It really drives me crazy

Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting

So baby come on home with me, I like the way you give it to me!



Chorus: K-Ci, JoJo



I like the way you give it to me -- let me see you toss it up

[K-Ci, JoJo]

Ohhh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm that want you lady

Ohhh, don't act so shady, baby your taste as fine as gravy

The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang

Girl you make my bells rang, make them go ting-a-ling!

Now the man, I'm here again

Don't worry to ever end

It's feeling too good

Gimme some more, oh lady lady

Your body the kind I like-ah

Big booty to the lung delight-ah

Bag it up yo, let me in there

Toss it up for me!!



Chorus 1/2



[Tupac]

Do you want me what's your phone number, I get around

Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now

Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin for paydays

No longer Dre Day, arrivederci

Blown and forgotten, rotten for plottin Child's Play

Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize

Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move

Cross Death Row, now who you gon' run to?

Lookin for suckers cause you similar

Pretendin to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature

Screamin Compton, but you can't return, you ain't heard

Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs

Mob on to this new era, cause we Untouchable

Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushin you

Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed

Who can you trust, only time reveals -- toss it up!



Chorus w/ variations



[Tupac]

Play on playa, play on

How can some non-players do a song about Compton

and then wanna do a player song?

How can non-players do it? (We not little kids, we not playin)

Tellin lies, who?

Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon

You still ain't touchin us, all that peace talk

I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street boy

It's on

Toss it up, we took you on, and we took y'all beat

You know we beat you down, and we took y'all beat

Cause you wasn't rockin it right

Tired of suckers rockin it, toss it up, is how we did it

Yeah, toss it up now!"

Cause they deserve it; with money got murdered

They know we died slow if they heard it

The nigga there blew up the spot a while

and the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while

And the stacks will light up, will fuck the night up

blow everything in sight up

fuck around and I'll have your ass right up

What makes you think, you wasn't able to stand

I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand

The days are longer and seems like I'm wastin time

I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasin mine

I suck it all up like a sicka fly

Cause nowadays gettin' by, nothing more than an occasional meal and

gettin high, I live to die, That's where I'm headed

Let your man hold somethin, now it's all about you can get it

Lucky that you breathin but you dead from the waste down

The fuck is on your mind? Talkin that shit that you be talkin

And I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walkin

But shit happens and fuck it, you would of did ya dirt

niggaz is wonderin how the fuck you hid your skirt

Right under they eyes like a surprise to the guys

just one of their mans was a bitch in disguise

fuckin with cats in order heads and slaughter more kids

Let me hollar at you all that wanna borrow the raw shit (ah-oh!)

Knahmean? I'm just robbin to eat

And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin the street

When we starve and we eat whatever's there

Come on you know the code in the street, whatever's fair

Blood stains and chalk, cause yo man couldn't walk

After the talk, heard him out at 1133 of New York

Transformin us niggaz so get it quick

You know for real that nigga can't fuckin suck my dick

And it's gon' take all these niggaz in the rap game

to barely move me, cause when I blow s..t up

I have niggaz fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie

Ah, you know I don't know how to act

Get too close to niggaz, it's like:

""Protected by viper, stand back""

What's that, a bunch of niggaz you was killas demented

Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you - on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun

Everything you did has already been done

I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston

My ting done made your kingdom wan' run

Now understand L. Boogie's non violent

But if a thing test me, run for mi gun

Can't take a threat to mi newborn son

L's been this way since creation

A groupie call, you fall from temptation

Now you wanna ball over separation

Tarnish my image in your conversation

Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion

You might win some but you just lost one



You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one



Now, now how come your talk turn cold

Gained the whole world for the price of your soul

Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control

Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold

Wisdom is better than silver and gold

I was hopeless now I'm on Hope road

Every man want to act like he's exempt

When him need to get down on his knees and repent

Can't slick talk on the day of judgement

Your movement's similar to a serpent

Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?

Consequence is no coincidence

Hypocrites always want to play innocent

Always want to take it to the full out extent

Always want to make it seem like good intent

Never want to face it when it's time for punishment

I know that you don't wanna hear my opinion

But there come many paths and you must choose one

And if you don't change then the rain soon come

See you might win some but you just lost one



You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one



You might win some but you really lost one

You just lost one, it's so silly how come

When it's all done did you really gain from

What you done done, it's so silly how come

You just lost one



Now don't you understand man universal law

What you throw out comes back to you, star

Never underestimate those who you scar

Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard

You can't hold God's people back that long

The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong

Trying to pretend like your word is your bond

But until you do right, all you do will go wrong

Now some might mistake this for just a simple song

And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone

Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn

And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn

Now, some might listen and some might shun

And some may think that they've reached perfection

If you look closely you'll see what you've become

Cause you might win some but you just lost one



You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one



You might win some but you really lost one

You just lost one, it's so silly how come

When it's all done did you really gain from

The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style boy you know what I'm sayin?

[50 Cent]

R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P-A-C, R.I.P niggas that wanna OD

Aiyyo the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal

If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal

You better recognize nigga I'm straight from the street

These industry niggaz startin to look like somethin to eat

I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ""You wanna see her again?""

Get your ass down to the nearest ATM

I have dreams of fuckin an R&B bitch

And I'll wake up early and bounce with all your shit

When I apply pressure,son it aint even funny

I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money

Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime

Have Keith sweatin starin down the barrel from my nine

Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam

I put the gun to Cardan tell him, ""Tell your man

Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now

I mean right now""

The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail

An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell

I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time

Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine

I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks

Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped

What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin to live for

Don't want no nigga puttin four thru that Bentley Coupe door

I'll man handle Mariah like ""Bitch get on the ground""

You ain't with Tommy no more who gonna protect you now?

I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me

Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me

I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick

I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit

Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think

About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink

I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run

This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?



[Madd Rapper](Chorus) 2x

This aint serious

Being broke can make you delirious

So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger

50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry nigga?



[50 Cents]

Ill catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies

And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami

Run up on Timberland and Missy w/the pound

Like you gimme the cash and u put the hot dog down

I figured it out 

Been robbin Joe before that's why his ass 

don't wanna be a playa no more

Mad at you I'm robbin J.D., FUCK YOU!! PAY ME!!

Had Da Brat with em, shoulda had his gat with him

DMX wanna get down well you tell homey

I'm on that Treach shit, I do my +Dirt All By My Lonely+

I should rob Clue man his shit did well

I wanna stick TQ but his shit ain't sell

I hit the studios take shit and leave

Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny ass rings

Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three

Ill beat your ass like that white boy on MTV

Cannibus wanna battle while I'm stickin them up

Nigga get capped coroners pickin em up

Heavy tried to hide his shit, nigga try to stall ya

He said ""Why you robbin me I got _Nuttin But Love_ for ya!""

Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece

Told him I want it all he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""

I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep

One at a time get out and take off your shine

Did you ever think that you would be this rich?

Did you ever think that you would have these hits?

Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?

And walk off with your shit like it's mine?

I'ma keep stickin niggas until I'm livid

I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins

Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens

I'm hungry for real im bout to stick Mister C

That nigga still eatin off Big's first LP

I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor

He asked me if I had enuff I told him ""Gimme Some More""

Is you feelin this? Then wait for the sequel

I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin Gods People



[Madd Rapper] 

(chorus)

For real yo you know what I'm sayin?

Niggas got to get stuck up that's just how it goes down

It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga

It don't matter, if you got it and I need it I want it

50 Cents ain't fuckin around

Track Masters ain't fuckin around

Crazy Cat ain't fuckin around

The Madd Rapper aint fuckin around

So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets

Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus

""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him

Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose

But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms

Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't

But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose



""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""

And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss

And that's the message that we deliver to little kids

And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they gonna know what intercourse is

By the time they hit fourth grade

They got the Discovery Channel don't they?

""We ain't nothing but mammals""

Well, some of us cannibals

Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes

Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope

But if you feel like I feel, I got the anecdote

Women wave your panty-hoes, sing the chorus and it goes



I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



Cuz I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records

Well I do so ""Fuck him and fuck you too!""

You think I give a damn about a Grammy?

Half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""

Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here

So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears

Shit Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst

And hear them argue over who she gave head to first

You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV



""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""

I should download her audio on MP3 and show the whole world

how you gave Eminem VD

I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups

All you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me

Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me

Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me

And just might be the next best thing but not quite me!



I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



Cuz I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



I'm like a head trip to listen to cuz I'm only giving you

Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room

The only difference is I got the balls to say it

In front of y'all and I don't gotta be frost or sugar coated at all

I just get on a mic and spit it and whether you like to admit it

I just shitted better than 90 percent of you rappers out there

Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums

It's funny cuz at the rate I'm going when I'm 30

I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting

Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens

And I'm jerkin?but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working



And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking

He could be working at Burger King spitting on your onion rings

Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming ""I don't give a fuck!""

With his windows down and his system up

So, will the real Shady please stand up?

And put one of those fingers on each hand up?

And be proud to be outta ya mind and outta control

And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?



I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



Cuz I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

A visionary, vision is scary

Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves

A rebel, so just let me revel and bask

In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?

Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna

Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter

The center of attention, back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling

Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

Testing, attention please

Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me

Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?



Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me



A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with

Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""

Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie

You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!

You don't know me, you're too old, let go

It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal

I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults

I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems

Everybody only wants to discuss me

So this must mean I'm disgusting

But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley

To do black music so selfishly

And use it to get myself wealthy

(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works

Twenty million other white rappers emerge

But no matter how many fish in the sea

It'll be so empty without me



Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

This motherfucker man, just won't shut up will you? 
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me 
I'm promoting you right now
Man lets put the nail in his coffin 


[Chorus]

I dont want to be like this 

I dont really want to hurt no feelins 

But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap 

Old men have heart attacks 

and I dont want to be responsible for that so 

Put the mic down and walk away 

You can still have a little bit of dignity 



[verse 1]

I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino 

an 83 year old fake Pachino 

So how can he hold me over some balcony 

without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me 

Please dont, youl probably fall with me 

and our asses will both be history 

But then again youl finnally get your wish 

cuz youl be all over the street like 50 Cent 

Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump 

gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up 

Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up 

And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck 

dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin 

You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin 

and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearences 

and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists 

dont even respect you or take you serious 

Its not that we dont like you, we hate you - period 

Talk about a mid-life crisis damn 

last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand 

Now hes a busta? What the fucks with that? 

Get on a track dissin us kissin 50's ass 

and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me 

bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me! 

What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man 

ready to take whatever sentence he hands 

What you know about your wife slicin her wrists 

right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl? 

And I put that on her, when this is all over 

I would never try to make her a star and eat off her 

I dont know shit about no shoppin rocks 

But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots? 

When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin 

pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin 

them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos 

Just makin copys of your covers of casette singles 

and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer 

Spendin your whole paycheck at Disc Makers 

What you know about bein bullied over half your life? 

Oh thats right, you know what thats like, your half white 

Vanilla Ice,spill the beans and rice, Im eaten you alive inside 

Jesus Christ, if your that much of a gangster, put the mic down 

You should be out killin motherfuckers right now 

Kill a motherfucker dead, kill'em dead bitch 

Shoot'em in the fuckin head, go ahead bitch 

Slap my mom, slap the f*ck outa her! 

She cant sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you 

Cuz your broke as fuck you suck your a fuckin joke 

If you was really sellin coke, well then what the fuck 

you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack 

you'd make alot more money than you do from rap 

You never had no security, you'll never be famous 

You'l never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it? 

Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens 

terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this 

and Canibus they usin too many complicated fuckin words for you 

Here then let me slow it down for you 

so you can understand if I say it slower: 

Let it go dawg it's over 



[Chorus]



[Eminem talkin]

Haha 

Talkin bout I have motherfuckers callin your crib 

bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib 

You aint even got a fuckin phone, fuckin Bum

Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin Source magazine 

if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first 

take it like a man and shut the fuck up 

and fuck your little magazine too 

I dont need your fuckin magazine, I got XXL number anywayz 

And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin bigger than yall 

oh, and by the way, howed I look on the VMAs? 

When you was watchin me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin me from in Boston 

The mean streets of Boston, fuckin sissy 

Like you got us scared in the motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin dicks 

Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo, the Source has a white owner"
21-Nov-02,"""The Sauce""",Eminem,Benzino,2002,"[Eminem talkin']
Its all bad now man, its all bad 
But yal done fucked up now 
Yeah ha ha, new shit, hey yo 
I just want the whole world to know: 
That I did not start this, but I will finish it 



[Verse]

Comin up it never mattered was color you was 

If you could spit then you could spit, thats it, thats what it was 

Back when, motherf*ckers was straight back packin 

Cypherin, fightin for life in this rap 

for the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped 

and you hyped cuz you last and you might whoop some ass 

If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man 

and you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column 

at The Source was like, the only source of light 

When the mics used to mean somethin, a four was like 

you were the ****, now its like the least you get 

three and a half now just means you a peice of **** 

four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas, 

or Benzino I dont think you even realize 

you playin with motherf*ckers lives, I dont watched Dre 

get ****ed on The Chronic, probably cuz I was on it 

Now you f*cked me outa my mics twice I let it slide 

I said I wouldnt hold my f*cken breathto get a five 

Sh*t I was right, Ida f*ckin died already tryin 

I swear to God I never lie I bet thats why 

you let that b*tch give me that bullsh*t review 

I sat and took it, I aint look at the sh*t we knew 

You'd probly try to f*ck us with Obie and 50 too 

F*ck a relationship we through 

No more Source with street cred, them days is dead 

Dre's got A-Ks to dave mase's head 

Every issue there's an eight page Made-Mens spread 

Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head 

That I am not afraid, hes just a f*ckin waste of lead 

on my pencil, for me to write some sh*t this simple 

So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed 

This old Gs bout to get smoked like raw weed 

You dont know me or my motherf*ckin mother you motherf*ckin punk 

Put me on your motherf*ckin cover to sell your little sell out mag 

I aint mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad 

You wanna talk about some sh*t that you dont know about? ya 

Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there 

To try to eat off him, cuz you missed your boat 

Your never gonna float b*tch your just too old 

No wonder your sore now ?? your bored now 

Im pushin thirty your kickin fourty's door down 

B*tch this is war now, and youl never beat me 

all you do is cheat me out of quatables but you know 

that youl always see me on your TV 

Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin 

To see your video played once on BET 

So he-he-he who gets the last laugh? 

Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff 

kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back 

Just know that Benzinos wack 

no matter how many times I say his name, hell never blow jack 

Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back 

Look at your track record thats how far it goes back 

Its extortion ?? proportion 

so half of the staff up there is fresh outa jail from boston 

Bullyin and bossin, caged like a slave they've completely brainwashed him 

And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest 

fakest, wannabe gangster in New York 

And its pitiful, cuz I never woulda said sh*t to you if you'd kept your mouth shut 

B*tch now what? get a clue, spit it slay 

New sh*t, exclusive ?? whoo kid

You know what to do with this: use it 

Im through, this is stupid, I cant believe I stooped to this 

bullsh*t to do this...

You don't have to say, what you did

I already know, I found out from him

There is just no chance, of you and me, there'll never be

You told me you loved me

Why did you leave me, all alone?

Now you tell me you need me

When you call me, on the phone

With some other guy

Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn

To cry, cry me a river

That some things are better left unsaid

It wasn't like you only talked to him

And you know it (don't act like you don't know it)

All of the these things people told me

Keep messing with my head (messing with my head)

You should have picked honesty

Then you may not have lost the game

Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman
Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back

Suddenly the target don't know how to act

So he does what any little boy will do

Making up a few false rumors or two



That for sure is not a man to me

Slanderin' names for popularity

It's sad you only get your fame through controversy

So what do we do girls?

Shout louder!

Lift your hands high and wave them proud

Never can, never will, can't hold us down



Nobody can hold us down

Are you offended by the message I'm bringing

Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing

If you look back in history

It's a common double standard of society

While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore

Start a new beginning for us everybody sing

Take a deep breath and say it loud

Never can, never will, can't hold us down



Check it - Here's something I just can't understand

If the guy have three girls then he's the man

He can either give us some head, sex her off

If the girl do the same, then she's a whore

But the table's about to turn

I'll bet my fame on it

Cats take my ideas and put their name on it

It's aiight though, you can't hold me down

I got to keep on movin'

To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack

Do it right back to him and let that be that

You need to let him know that his game is whack

And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back



But you're just a little boy

Think you're so cute, so coy

You must talk so big 

To make up for small lil' things

So you're just a little boy

All you'll do is annoy

You must talk so big

22-May-06,"""Georgia Bush""",Lil Wayne,George Bush,2006,"This song right here, is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, lost city of New Orleans... we call him this
(Georgia x 8 with Wayne)

Noooowww

This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit

Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue

So called beef wit you know who

Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops

Look at the bullshit we been through

Had the niggas sittin on top they roofs

Hurricane Katrina, we shoulda called it Hurricane (Geeoorrggiaa) Bush

Then they tellin y'all lies on the news

The white people smiling like everythin cool

But I know people that died in that pool

I know people that died in them schools

Now what is the survivor to do?

Got to no trailer, you gotta move

Now it's on to Texas and to (Geeoorrggiiaa)

They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see

But they don't let you know what's really goin on

Make it look like a lotta stealin goin on

Boy them cops is killas in my home

Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street

I ain't no thief, I'm just tryin to eat

Man fuck the police and president (Geeoorrrggiiaa) Bush

So what happened to the leverage, why wasn't they steady

Why wasn't they able to control this?

I know some fok' that live by the lever

that keep on tellin me they heard this, stole this

Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy

1965, I ain't too young to know this

That was President Johnson now

but it's president (Geeoorrggiiaa) Bush



[Chorus - 2X]

We from a town where (Georgia)

Everybody drowned, and

Everybody died, but baby I'm still prayin wich ya

Everybody cryin but (Georgia)

Aint nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush



Noooowwww

I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map

New Orleans baby, now the white house hatin, tryin to wash away like we not on the map

Wait, have you heard the latest, they sayin you gotta have paper if you tryin to come back

Niggas thinkin it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Geeoorrggiaa)

Noooww it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say dont worry bout it

And the children have been scarred, no ones here to care bout em

And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out

Yea we like it they callin y'all, but fuck president (Geeoorrggiaa) Bush

We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is

A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him

And no he ain't gonna drop no dollas, but he do drop bombs

R.I.P. Tay cuz he died in the storm, fuck president (Geeoorrggiiaa) Bush

See us in ya city man, give us a pound

Cuz if a nigga still movin then he holdin it down

I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es

I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yea!



[Chorus]



(DJ Drama: oh yea, you thought we was done? Naw)



YEA!

Money money money get a dollar and a dick

Weezy Baby that crack, muthafucka get a fix

Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich

Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist YES

Yep, I'm a muthafuckin trip

I'ma trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit

Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams

If you talkin bout bricks, I'm the interstate man

And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing

Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring

Walkin a thin line, gotta defend mine

And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM

Young toon, yea that's what my people call me

Fifty thousand for the cause, tryin keep the reaper off me

I drink a lotta syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walkin

Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea

Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip

And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly

Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties

Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be da target

Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded

We done lost everythin and you lookin like a bargain

Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant

I'm the best rapper in the game no argin (arguing)



And I don't ever write, pause

Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin

Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in

Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in

All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet

They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin

Mike Jordan, pardon my swag

Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family

We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami

I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me

Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me

Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya

I'm a beast, I'm a preacher, I'm the son of miss cita

Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason

Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even

There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her

Got a topic of this evenin, hotter than a tub steamin

Gotcha girlfriend dreamin of one day bein Trina

Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer

Got a white girl drivin, couldn't do it much cleaner

I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon

Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin

Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do

Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks

And bring me that Patrone, I don't play

No ice I like my drink straight, not gay

And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid

I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed

I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs

Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days

Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov

Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old

And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove

Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed

Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos

Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos

Price sizin for a show and the flow

So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe

Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve

If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse

There's no love between these walls

I was always happy

When I was watching you become a star

But you were only happy

When the world was openin' up my scars

And now I'm like the devil 

Well if I am then what does that make you

You sold yourself for your fame

You'll still never walk a day in my shoes

quieren quitarme del mando



Todos publican mi nombre

muchos con malas noticias

ya no ayan como quemarme

mientras me muero de risa

siganme dando mas fama

yo los miro de aca arriba



Sigan moviendo las Jefas

sigan poniendome peros

sigan buscandome el clavo

busquenle hasta que se encuentren

Dicen que viene la Jefa

miren como estoy temblando

no se de quien seran jefas

si nadie les hace caso

y las que dicen ser Reinas

son de un pueblo abandonado



Si fue el señor de los cielos

el que me puso en el puesto

no me quitaran de en medio

eso yo si se lo apuesto

la señora esta rifando

y me voy cuando yo quiero



No le busquen apeste al gas

si saben que van ayarle

pa que se meten conmigo

si no me meto con nadie

si querian que contestara

ahora vamos a atorarle

Only reason I dissed you in the first place
is cause you denied seein me
Now I'm pissed off
[Eminem]

Sit back homie relax, in fact grab a six-pack

Kick back while I kick facts, yeah Dre, sick track

Perfect way to get back, wanna hear somethin wick-wack?

I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back

I'm (Obsesseed) now, oh gee

Is that supposed to be me, in the video with the goatee?

Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out

Bitch shut the fuck up, 'fore I put all them phone calls out

you made to my house when you was (Wild'n Out) before Nick

When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about

How many times you fly to my house, still tryin to count

Better shut your lyin mouth if you don't want Nick findin out

You probably think cause it's been so long

if I had somethin on you I woulda did it by now

Oh on the contrary Mary Poppins I'm mixin our studio session down

and sendin it to masterin to make it loud

Enough dirt on you to murder you

This is what the fuck I do, Mariah it ever occur to you

that I still have pictures? However you prefer to do

and that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm scurred of you?

You're gonna ruin my career you better get one

Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt

that made me put up with her psycho ass over six months

And only spread her legs to let me hit once

Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky? Tell the public

that I was so ugly that you fuckin had to be drunk to fuck me?

Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick pumpkin?

The second week we were dry humpin, that's gotta count for somethin

Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about

how I nutted early cause I ejaculated prematurely

And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling

and said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling

Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin me I'm embarrassin you

And don't you dare say it isn't true

As long as that song's gettin airplay I'm dissin you

I'm a hair away from gettin carried away and gettin sued

I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32

This is 34 bars, we ain't even third of the way through

""Damn Slim, Mariah play you,"" Mariah who?

Oh, did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too

Like I been goin off on you all this time

for no reason, girl you out your alcoholic mind

Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine

Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time

I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme

But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line

And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb

I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find

on an episode of ""Cribs,"" a blow below the ribs

If I hear another word so don't go openin your jibs

Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs

I ain't sayin this shit again hoe, you know what it is

It's a warnin shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot

Call my bluff and, I'll release every fuckin thing I got

Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top

when me and Luis were tryin to stick two CD's in the same slot

Step out of line

And you get bitch-slapped back

And you can run

But the hand of god

Just smacked you back into yesterday

And you wonder why

No one can stand you

And there's no denying

You were crying like a bitch

Blinded by your sacred faded past times

Only time is your enemy

Granted a second chance

To prove that your arrogance

Is stronger than you'll ever be

Is stronger than you can be



Oh stronger than you can be

It's funny 'cause, you know, we've been asking people what they wanted to know.
I mean, clearly, you've been having this thing with Kim.
And I don't know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you're a rapper -
and I'm thinking, sure, I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming -
even though you say it's not specifically about her - that Roman's Revenge is for Kim.

[Nicki Minaj:]

Umm, you know, she just really jumped and you gotta be careful when you pick fights.

And that's what I've learned in this business, you just never know -

[Lil' Kim:]

SHUT THE FUCK UP!



[Lil' Kim:]

Who the fuck want war?

Fed-Ex beef straight to your front door.

It'll be a murder scene,

I'm turning Pink Friday to Friday the 13th.

Aight you Lil' Kim clone clown,

All this buffoonery shit stops now.

Time for you to lay down, I'm sick of the fraud,

I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage.

We all know your last name's what got you your job,

You's a put together gimmick, somethin' like a collage.

Since you're putting on a show you gon' get the applause -

Clap clap with your frame like a fucking garage (Yeaaaah)

This hood shit, you and Drake ain't built for --

This the shit the other bitch almost got killed for.

I'm still counting what Hard Core generated.

Bet my shit keep spendin' like a syndicated.

Corny broad, I leave you bloody like you menstruated.

You hot air ass bitch shoulda BEEN deflated.

This ain't a championship fight, I BEEN the greatest.



See the fact is... what you doin', I did it.

You lames tryna clone my style and run wit it.

That's cool, I was the first one wit it -

You's a Lil' Kim wannabe, you just hate to admit it.

I'm the blueprint; you ain't nothin' brand new,

Check your posters and videos,

you'll always be number two.

I seen 'em come, I seen' em go, still I remain.

Sweetie, you goin' on your 14th minute of fame,

I'm over 10 years strong still running the game

Cut the comparisons I'm in the legendary lane.

Fighting for a spot? Child please, I'm solidified.

With my hands tied, you couldn't beat me if you bitches tried.

Either you high or sippin' that shit Wayne on

I get top dollar for whateva my name on

Go stick your head in a tornado - brainstorm.

I drop bombs. Flex. Napalm.

Black and yellow, will pull up in your ghetto,

Giuseppes when I step out, post it up in stilettos.

Pussy so pink like my Kitty sayin' Hello,

If I whistle they'll pistol whip you in all five boroughs.



I'm from Brooklyn, I be everywhere comfortably.

Now who pumped you and told you to come romp wit me?

You the type to run your mouth and then run from me

I'm poppin' off in your hood wit no company.

Come on, Queens ain't showin' you no love,

I was there the other night poppin' bottles with a thug.

You like Washington. Heifer, I'm Benji.

You got a buzz right now, and I had a frenzy.

Oh yeah, welcome to the fam... Fendi.

You needa stop, you're not hot, you're a burning match

That means the end is near soon, copy that?

Ho, I see...they really got you gassed

Like I'm a thing of the past.

Better slow down, dummy, you 'bout to crash

STINK PUSSY HO! I'm giving you a bath,

Thermometer in hand and I'm comin' for your ass.

Who you think you gettin' past?

'I see right through you,' your whole shit is made of glass.



[Snippet of Nicki Minaj's ""Right Thru Me"" plays]



I draw back, I'm a Brooklyn Borough bitch,

Rep for my borough bitch,

Never been the type to have beef and try to settle shit.

I ride out 'til the wheels fall off

And my niggas squeeze 'til the last shell go off.

Fuck your whole team, all I see is a bunch of weirdos.

You's a airhead bitch... scarecrow.

Ha, ain't nothing old 'bout my money bitch. (Ha ha)

This is grown liquid assets.

Benjamin's my daddy, you Young Money bastards!

You and Diddy? Sorry, bunch of swaggerjackers.

I mothered you hos, I should claim you on my income taxes.

Bobby Fisch in the flesh, talk about a great.

So on my next move, I'm yelling checkmate.

I smell a massacre. I'm Charles Manson,

You don't stand a chance wit her.

Jeffrey Dahmer, you lookin' like lunch to me.

'Bout to kill all you bitches like Ted Bundy.

Leave your whole head red like Peg Bundy.

You're hilarious, thanks for all the laughs -

You're garbage, so I'm taking out the trash.

You, shit on me? C'mon baby girl...

Ain't enough ass shots in the world!

You're a nuisance, you'll probably steal my new shit

But you could never fuck with me, so chuck it up, deuces.

All around the world I ball like a ball team.

I stack chips, call me Mrs. Rothstein.

Trix is for kids, silly rabbit, you're my offspring.

Kim more anticipated than a LeBron ring.



[Lil Kim mocking Nicki Minaj:]

""I mean I know... I know you guys asked me if Roman's Revenge was about Kim...

and no, I, it's not about Kim...

Actually if Kim thought it was about her, I'm so sorry.

You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial, crazy

I don't get it

Your taste once exquisite



What happened to Brooklyn? What happened to New York

What happened to my scene? What happened to punk rock, rock



You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe

How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me

I don't get it, I'm so legit



Tell me, was it 'cause I wasn't platinum in jewels?

That perhaps you thought I was a little bit even uncool

Kid, was that it?



Stefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million

Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg

You're hurt, I know my words don't hurt, yeah



Oh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls

Thinking that you're number one

You're so funny, 'cause honey, you're not



What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier

They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here

But where, no magic in the air



What happened to Brooklyn? What happened to our scene, baby?

Have we all gone Gaga crazy?

Remember when the streets used to be dangerous and we were born bad

And we were born bad?



Punk rock, punk rock

The boys used to punch each other in the face and girls were walking around wasted

And everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight

Punk rock, rock, rock.

Wow, I'm honored that you think this is staged

I'm flattered man, in fact, I'm amazed

This shit a twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions



You boys are getting into your feelings on me

You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments

Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don't it?

Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it

None of them want this shit more than I want it

Easter egg hunting, they gotta look for something



Done doing favors for people

But rumor has it, hasn't done you niggas any good

29-Oct-16,"""Two Birds, One Stone""",Drake,"Pusha T, Kid Cudi and Meek Mill",2016,"Yeah
Yeah, more
Yeah
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right

It's only me but I'm seeing four shadows in the light

My demons visit me every night

To the most high I'm forever indebted

I know I gotta pay something, I know that day's coming

I put it all in the music

Because if I don't say it here then I won't say nothing

Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges

Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazing

I need to start losing my shit

Just to show you niggas who hatin'

Too reserved like I called ahead for me and my lady

Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting

Ever since the blue basement I found God and I lost patience

Between rocks and hard places of all places

Spotted everywhere like Dalmation

Cops snoop around cause all my dogs famous

Please welcome the October fall baby

Vaughan Road Academy, star playermy mind's not all there

Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer

People too scared to tell the truth so it's all dares

Counted us all there and we all square

Quick money, I'm in and out

My dad used to use a soap bar till it's thinning out

But shit, look at Dennis now

All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out

More blessings for Sandy and him, more life

My parents never got it right, but

God bless 'em both, I think we all alike

We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change

If we do get to do it twice in a another life

Scared to go to sleep now

Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like

Back when the bar I set for myself was out of sight

Tell me how I went and did chin ups

On this shit when I can't see it

Pin ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier, soul sisters

Inspired my old scriptures

Now that feeling gone like them old pictures

Mixing liquors got us both twisted

Words get so viscious, you just stare at me

While you roll swishers

Girl I love you, but I don't miss you

And no matter what year it is I'm an old 6'er

Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school man

Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy

2 percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it

Got two of my niggas off with a not guilty

Gave back to the city and never said it

If I didn't live it but still they try to tell you I'm not the realest

Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit

Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon

I never worked to get it

But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories

That's gotta stop though

You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo

If you ask me though you ain't lining the trunk with kilos

You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas

Like ""this what we need to be on,"" but you never went live

You middle man in this shit, boy you was never them guys

I can tell cause I look most of you dead in your eyes

And you'll be trying to sell that story for the rest of your lives

Can't show us where the cash is

Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is

Numbers inflated

They all look at me like, ""What have you done for me lately?""

I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest

Awe baby, stop debating, I'm just a creative

My numbers out of this world

No wonder they got me feeling so alienated

You were the man on the moon

Now you just go through your phases

Life of the angry and famous

Rap like I know I'm the greatest

Then give you the tropical flavors

Still never been on hiatus

You stay xanned and perked up

So when reality set in you don't gotta face it

I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis

It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces

I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places

Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy

Is you crazy?"

(Lose) I prove you lost already



They told you your whole career I'd come home and kill you, right? Ha-ha!

I told you I wasn't talkin' about your dumb ass

It looks stupid, you literally got a dumb ass

Talkin' cray, and we all know that you dumb as

You get Donkey of the Day, yeah, you dumb ass

Let's be honest, you stole that line 'bout bitches bein' your sonshow you take my '09 jail tweet and run?

Talkin' about bringin' knives to a fight with guns

When the only shot you ever took was in your buns

And I saw Meek at All-Star, he told me your ass dropped

He couldn't fuck you for three months

Because your ass dropped

Now I don't think y'all understand how bad her ass got

The implants that she had put in her ass popped

I was like, ""Damn, 90 days and you couldn't have box?

Did she at least compensate? Start givin' you mad top?

Her name Minaj, right? She ain't throw you some bad thots?""

He said ""Nah,"" that's when I knew you was really a trash bop

You was screamin' ""Free Remy!"" when I was upstate doomed

But now that they freed Remy, you don't sing the same tune

Locked me up, threw away my keys, threw away my weaves

Snatched me from my son, braids to the back, state greens

Daily News, ""Her career's over,"" ""She was kinda stupid,""

But you saw a opportunity 'cause you a opportunist

Left your Day 1 'cause you heard he was on some cheat shit

Then got with the dude that told you on some creep shit

But what happened to Omeeka? Nah, on some G shit

Left him and took a pic with the dude he had beef with?

And we all know it was a beef that you started

Pillow-talkin' out of your ass, this bitch retarded

Now you gotta die, you dearly departed

Bloodbath when I catch you, a real red carpet

Now what I'ma do, I'ma just stick to the facts

Bitch so scared of my future, got this bitch goin' backwards

Been through mad crews, you disloyal hoochie

Now all of a sudden you back with Drake and Tunechi?

After he said you sucked his dick, you back with Gucci?

Who next: Puff, Deb, or Fendi? You a A-list groupie

And to be the Queen of Rap, you gotta actually rap

The whole industry know that your shit is a wrap

No, to be the Queen of Rap, you can't have a ghostwriter

And that's why this is my house; Flo Rida

Niggas done seen Drake pennin', Wayne pennin'

And since your first boyfriend left, bitch ain't winnin'

You a Internet troll, a Web browser, I'm sorry

You can't get her online without Safaree

Mentionin' guns, you Pussy Galore, James Bond

Only time you touch a trigga is when you fucked Trey Songz

Coke head, you cheated on your man with Ebro

I might leak the footage of you sniffin' them ski slopes

They gassin' you up, but you been on E, though

""Pills and Potions,"" yep, you been on E, hoe

Got your ghostwriters back, so you think you lit

Rem Belushi, I'm a Ghostbuster, bitch

I'm supposed to be scared

'Cause you bought your Barbie chain back?

I'll revert to ""Ante Up,"" you'll get your Barbie chain yapped

Tried to front in February, catch you in that Maybach

Show you how to use your name, you be usin' your name wack

I'm sayin', how you mix Nicki with a Minaj?

I'ma park this bitch, put Nicki in the garage

I'm gettin' money like Nicky Barnes, I'm the big homie

I responded in less than 48 Hours; Nick Nolte

Gettin' close like Nick Jonas, grippin' the gauge

Then blaze off, Face Off, bitch, Nicolas Cage

You animated like Nickelodeon, you fake, bitch

Only the kids believe in you; you St. Nick

Now when I shoot Nick at Nite, they won't understand it

I'm Wild'n Out, 'bout to hit Nick with the Cannon

How are you on the VMAs, actin' like you hood?

Way across the stage, talkin' about ""Miley, what's good?""

That's Hannah Montana, she was always happy

You only fronted on Mariah 'cause Mariah don't carry

Tried to disrespect Taylor 'cause Taylor wasn't Swift enough

Pillsbury Doughgirl; Remy pick the biscuit up

I'm jealous? Bitch, you was happy when they took me

Best thing that ever happened to you was when they booked me

You said you never fucked Waynehow stupid I look, B?

Get the picture, I'll expose you, I'm kind of a bully

You named yourself Nicki Lewinsky, the mind of a rookie

'Cause you was suckin' his dick

And now he tired of your nookie

You claimed you never fucked Drake

Now that's where you took me

You fucked the whole Empirewho you tryin' to be, Cookie?

Boogie Down Bronx, I come out of the Boogie

To let you know real bitches never lie on their pussy

And stop talkin' numbers, you signed a 360 deal

Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic

Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it

Any videos, promotions come out of your budget

Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it

You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat

I own my masters, bitch, independent

So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten

Stop comparin' yourself to Jay, you not like him

You a motherfuckin' worker, not a boss like Rem

You're done, them pop chicks ain't get the news yet

Bitch, I pop chicks, yeah, and I'm the new vet

I kill rappers, and you good as dead, bitch

Talkin' shit about me to a deaf bitch

And usually I have sympathy for the impaired

But not when you hard of hearin' from untreated gonorrhea

But you point your fingers at me? I'm the bad girl

When she the one out here misleadin' the black girls?

All these fake asses influenced by that girl

Dyin' from botched surgerieswhat a sad world!

But before the butt job, you was a Spongebob

Suckin' cock for records, captain of the cum squad

And I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz

Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj

You paid for your brother's wedding? That's hella foul

How you spendin' money to support a pedophile?

He a walkin' dead man, sendin' threats to him

I guess that's why they call you Barbie, you was next to Ken

Talkin' about your money long and your foreign sick

Why you ain't help your bro hide his cum from forensics?

You probably somewhere overseas, foreign sick

Thought you could fuck with me, by far Rem sick

Meek, Drake, Safaree, I see men in your pants

We call that Jelani, get it? Semen in your pants

Uh, I got trigger fingers, you got bitter fingers

Yeah, you must think you Drake and I'm Twitter fingers

VH1, watch this

You just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch



Don't ever in your fuckin' life play with me

That's on the set!

You tried it on the Rae Sremmurd record

You tried it on your little freestyle

They was both duds, just like every other one was duds

Just like this last one was a dud

Erasing our chances

Just by asking

All I wanted was the music and
My parents were doing everything they could
To move away from our place working over time always
While I sat up in my grandma's project building coloring, oh

Moved to a small town and started to, started to grow

Poetry written, I'm singing and dancing, oh

Photographs, painting, cartoons

That's all I know

That's all I know, oh



I have one best friend to this very fucking day

Since we were five years old and I fucking moved away

I wish I never did cause she's the only one who sees me

For who I really am instead of how many I reach, oh



Trusted too many fake people while I was still young

Gave them the benefit of the doubt, I was so wrong

I cut them off and they came for blood cause they know

They ain't getting no more



I'm so done with playing piggy back, oh

Swear to god I wished y'all all the best, oh

You're lying your way to try to gain a piece of me

When you could never come close cause I know my destiny

I worked hard for my shit

Put my love in this shit

Now you're trying to kill my name for some fame

What is this?

Tried to help you do your shit

Encouraged you to work on it

Was a good friend and you used that to your advantage



Now I'm 22 and I've had a crazy year of

Isolation from all the plastic people here

I cannot wait for the day

I can finally move away

Back to New York City where the realest people really stay, oh



Spent this whole time writing away my heart and my soul

The people I surround myself with have hearts filled with gold

Love and empathy are things that we hold so close

Trying to learn and evolve



I'm so done with playing piggy back, oh

Swear to god I wished y'all all the best, oh

You're lying your way to try to gain a piece of me

When you could never come close cause I know my destiny

I worked hard for my shit

Put my love in this shit

Now you're trying to kill my name for some fame

Tried to help you do your shit

Encouraged you to work on it

I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em

I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness

Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too

But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you





Shoo, shoo, shoo

Shoo, shoo, shoo

Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee



Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay

Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay

I ain't thinkin' about no reaper

Nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay

Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay

Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay

Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by your throwaway

And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame

Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?

Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play

Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?

Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?

Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight

I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die

They turn into nuns, then hop online, like ""Pray for my city""

He fakin' for likes and digital hugs

His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done

Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky

I'll park his son

The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way

I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes

Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage

I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave

Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted

What is it? The braids?

I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay

It's three G.O.A.T.s left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage

I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh

It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh

I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh

You know I got language barriers, huh

It's no accent you can sell me, huh

Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga

The crown is heavy, huh

I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly

I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef

Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T

You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me

He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet

We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way

I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint

This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest

It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater

I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress

I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct

We hate the bitches you fuck, 'cause they confuse themself with real women

And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'

How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?

How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?

I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough

You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'

Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one

Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from

V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one

Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk



Remember?

Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?

Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch

I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous

Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with

I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress

Surprised you wanted that feature request

You know that we got some shit to address

I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess

Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess

Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed

Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat

I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet

Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? Bet

When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches

I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em

Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya

You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga

Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?

Ho, what? You ain't like that record?

""Back To Back,"" I like that record

I'ma get back to that, for the record

Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?

That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that

Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that

Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that

Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that

Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that

Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that

Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you

Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too

Tell BEAM that he better stay right with you

Am I battlin' ghost or AI? Nigga feelin' like Joel Osteen

Funny, he was in a film called ""AI""

And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him

I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin

Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders

Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence

What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast

And I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it

Pick a nigga off one at a time with it

We can be on a three-hour time difference

Don't speak on the family, crodie

It can get deep in the family, crodie

Talk about me and my family, crodie?

Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie

I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie

Tell me you're cheesin', fam

We can do this right now on the camera, crodie

Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas

I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm

Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food

Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too

If you take it there, I'm takin' it further

Psst, that's somethin' you don't wanna do



Ooh

And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me

You better have some paperwork or that shit fakе tea

Can't be rappin' 'bout no rattin' that we can't rеad

I mean it's true a nigga slimed me for my AP

Just like how Metro nigga slimed him for his main squeeze

Out here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please

Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed

You just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe

Don't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees

Say you hate the girls I fuck, but what you really mean?

I been with Black and white and everything that's in between

You the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen

And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem

On some Bobby shit, I wanna know what Whitney need

All that puppy love was over in y'all late teens

Why you never hold your son and tell him, ""Say cheese""?

We could've left the kids out of this, don't blame me

You a dog and you know it, you just play sweet

Your baby mama captions always screamin', ""Save me""

You did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace

I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free

Don't make it Dave Free's

Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees

Hands on your knees, hands on your knees

Shake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for free

Yeah, yeah

Well, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave

Your man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'

He always said I overlooked him, I was starin' straight

These bars go over Kenny head no matter what I say

I know you like to keep it short, so let me paraphrase

Knew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the serenade

Nigga said, ""Uh, uh""

Almost started reachin' for my waist



Drop, drop, drop, drop

Drop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot

Drop a fifty bag, twenty-nine for the thot

Yeah, look



If Drake shooters doing TikToks, nigga

Realest shooter in your gang, that's P's brother, y'all ain't getting shit shot, nigga

Can't listen to the stick talk in falsetto, save it for a hip-hop nigga

You don't even be at home, dog, you a souvenir-out-the-gift-shop nigga

Still mad about that one ho, we ain't even fuck, I just lip-locked with her

I get active when it's war time, I ain't even really let my dick drop, nigga

What the fuck I heard Rick drop, nigga? Talkin' somethin' 'bout a nose job, nigga

Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y'all niggas

Put a nigga in the bars, let a nigga rot, kind of like your old job, nigga

House sittin' on some land, but it's out where no one even really know y'all niggas

Bitches gotta drive two hours 'fore you pay 'em just to give a blowjob, nigga

Must've snorted up a snowball

Always knew I had to smoke y'all niggas

​good kid, m.A.A.d city van, we'll pop the latch and let the door slide

Tears runnin' down my cheek, laughin' at you pussies dyin', it's a war cry

Weeknd music gettin' played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride

That's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta, payin' just to find a tour guide

Abel, run your fuckin' bread, need to buy some more chains for some more guys

Let me find another street nigga I can take to the game courtside

Let me get a used Ferrari for a rapper, take the nigga on a horse ride

Anything to take the spotlight off the fact the boss is a drugged-out lil' punk sissy from the Northside

Rakim talkin' shit again

Gassed 'cause you hit my BM first, nigga, do the math, who I was hittin' then?

I ain't even know you rapped still 'cause they only talkin' 'bout your 'fit again

Probably gotta have a kid again 'fore you think of droppin' any shit again

Even when you do drop, they gon' say you should've modeled 'cause it's mid again

Smokin' Fenty 'bout it, should've put you on the first one, tryna get it in

She'll even tell you leave the boy alone 'fore you get your head split again

K-Dot shit is only hittin' hard when Baby Keem put his pen to it

West Coast niggas do fades, right? Come get this ass whoopin', I'm handin' 'em out

You wanna take up for Pharrell? Then come get his legacy out of my house

A cease and desist is for hoes, can't listen to lies that come out of your mouth

You called the Tupac estate and begged 'em to sue me and get that shit down

I'm losin' perspective on beef, Boi-1da send beat and I'll kill you for fun

Your daddy got robbed by Top, you Stunna and Wayne, like father, like son

Anthony set up the plays, Kojo be chargin' you double for nothin'

They shook about what I'ma say, but textin' your phone like, ""We already won""

You tell me what I shouldn't say, but fuck it, my nigga, it's already done

We already know it's a twenty-v-one, we already know why you went number one

It's clearly because of The Boy, the honorable thing is to give me the loot

You right about ""Fuck the big three,"" it's only Big D, and there's video proof

Our sons should go play at the park, two lightskin kids, that shit would be cute

We get it, we got it

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

We get that you like to put gin in your juice

We get that you think that you Bishop in Juice

When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?

Your back is up against the curb, you diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof

Why did you move to New York? Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?

Proposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife

I'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?

'Cause we know the girls that you actually like

Your darkest secrets are comin' to light

It's all on your face like what happened to Mike

Oh shit, it's all makin' sense, maybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike

Michael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white

Top would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites

And wait, you say your brother Jermaine, but you wanted him to stay out of the light

Oh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?

I get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice

Head to Delilah with all of my ice, head to Delilah with all of my ice

This shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?

You're dead

You're dead, you're dead

I'm sorry that that man is your father, let me be honest
It takes a man to be a man, your dad is not responsive
I look at him and wish your grandpa woulda wore a condom
I'm sorry that you gotta grow up and then stand behind him
Life is hard, I know, the challenge is always gon' beat us home

Sometimes our parents make mistakes that affect us until we grown

Hey, you're a good kid that need good leadership

Let me be your mentor since your daddy don't teach you shit

Never let a man piss on your leg, son

Either you die right there or pop that man in the head, son

Never fall in the escort business, that's bad religion

Please remember, you could be a bitch even if you got bitches

Never code-switch, whether right or wrong, you're a Black man

Even if it don't benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline

Don't cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did

Don't pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership

Understand, no throwin' rocks and hidin' hands, that's law

Don't be ashamed 'bout who you wit', that's how he treat your moms

Don't have a kid to hide a kid to hide again, be sure

Five percent will comprehend, but ninety-five is lost

Be proud of who you are, your strength come from within

Lotta superstars that's real, but your daddy ain't one of them

Dear Sandra

Your son got some habits, I hope you don't undermine them

Especially with all the girls that's hurt inside this climate

You a woman, so you know how it feels to be in alignment

With emotion, hopin' a man can see you and not be blinded

Dear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator

Even usin' you to prove who he is is a huge favor

I think you should ask for more paper, and more paper

And more, uh, more paper

I'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions

Psychopath intuition, the man that like to play victim

You raised a horrible fuckin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis

Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen

Mm-mm, your son's a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die

Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life

He hates Black women, hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish

Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better

He got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance

A child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them

And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'

Fuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose

I been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret

It's some weird shit goin' on and some of these artists be here to police it

They be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender

Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas

To any woman that be playin' his music, know that you're playin' your sister

Or better, you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos, not the good ones

Katt Williams said, ""Get you the truth,"" so I'ma get mines

The Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time

Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away

To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away

They lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away

I'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe



Dear baby girl

I'm sorry that your father not active inside your world

He don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure

He a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs

Try destroyin' families rather than takin' care of his own

Should be teachin' you time tables or watchin' Frozen with you

Or at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you

Instead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve

I wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind

You got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind

'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion

Money's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to

His father prolly didn't claim him neither

History do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason

But I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child

Give him grace, this the reason I made Mr. Morale

So our babies like you can cope later

Give you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later

I never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior

Sittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation

You need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain

I'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains

Yes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right

And a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say ""more life""

Dear Aubrey

I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party

But truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body

This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game

But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name

Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?

Guess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you

And I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home

Thirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old

You got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems

Bad with money, whorehouse

Solicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start

But I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom

I try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'

Crave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'

No dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in

No secret handshakes with your friend

No culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother

Identity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya

The skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas

Can't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman

You a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?

You embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us

Take that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements

Why believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in

'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery

You lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury

You lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members

They all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em

You lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh

You lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come

You lied about the only artist that can offer you some help

I wanted everybody right here with me

But that was my fault being too friendly

I was thinking everything was all good

But the whole time you was my enemy

Only time y'all niggas in agreement

Is when all y'all tryna go against me

Only time y'all weak hoes link up

It's when another bitch tryna get rid of me

I don't give a fuck, yeah, I'll go to war with the whole world

Street niggas, rap niggas comin' for the Hot Girl

My name start all the discourse

Hatin' for the states are the opps and the homeboys

This tough guy act, so forced

Y'all are standin' on business with pro-choice

'Cause the niggas don't beef with the niggas

They scared of each other but beat on the women



I just want y'all hoes to know

Whatever don't pay me, don't phase me (No)

And I don't know which nigga this week I want to entertain me

So stop pussy watchin', bitch

The boss boat bigger than a nigga gotta split me

Why would I go half with a nigga whose fit ain't be as big as my fittin'?

These niggas be jealous (Yeah)

See you doin' good, wanna fuck up your energy

Rich bitches better watch they back (Girl)

Fuck around be layed up with your enemy

Damn, bitch, it's been four years

Worry 'bout your man and your kids

Your life must be boring as fuck if you're stil reminiscin' 'bout shit we did

And I ain't worried 'bout the bitter bitch link up

Y'all hoes earned them seats in the fanclub

Ain't got no tea on me, this hoe think she TMZ

14-Jun-24,"""Double Life""",Pharrell Williams,Drake,2024,"Yeah, brraa
Yeah
Hey, what are you hiding? (Watch)
What you doin' when you're gone? (Hey)
Nothin' wrong bein' private (Watch)

Make sure it ain't wrong (Yeah)

Your life double-sided (Watch)

Two-faced like coins

What side do I get? (Watch)

What side are you on?



So what have you done? (Brraa)

Some of your dirt has come to light (Yeah)

Why were you speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off? (Yeah, hey)

And someone saw you in a fight

Am I right?



It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails

You just don't like the flip all thе time

But if you spin it, then you get to see both sidеs

Oh, the thrill of the double life



Lie detector time (Watch)

Do you feel bad when you lie? (Watch)

The look on your face says the best life (Watch)

And then come home like it's fine, am I right? (Watch)



So what have you done?

Some of your dirt has come to light (Yeah, yeah)

Why were you speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off? (Yeah, hey)

And someone saw you in a fight

Am I right? (Ah)



It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails

You just don't like the flip all the time

But if you spin it, then you get to see both sides

Oh, the thrill of the double life (Brrat)



Who will you be tonight?

That's the question (Brraa)

Who will Gru be tonight?

That's the question



I know you heard the rumors (Hey)

You must get over to it right away (Oh)

If anyone can do it

You gotta get there soon, it's not okay (Hey)

You got cars to drive, plenty jets to fly (Blah, blah)

When will you arrive? You're running out of time (Phew)

Don't you see that everything is on the line?

So, I'm sorry, but you have to choose a side



You'll never know when it's your time to go (Side, hey)

And where you end up in life, that's cold (Side)

You can't ignore, you're spending your life (Blah, blah, side)

Your watch is broken 'cause you spent all your time (Side)

It's now or never unless everything rights (Side)

Before the spinning stops, you must pick a side (Hey, brraa)



Who will you be tonight?

That's the question (Blah, blah)

Who will Gru be tonight?

That's the question (Phew)

Who will you be tonight? (Hey)

That's the question (Yeah)

Who will Gru be tonight? (Ayy)

19-Jul-24,"""Yoshinoya""",Childish Gambino,Drake,2024,"That's my brother, don't you know it?
I stuck around like Yoshinoya
Stone Mountain read and the caster cord
This my life, I must enjoy it
This my life, they bus it for it
We don't hold back, we must go forward

Stay where you at, you're supposed to, boy

Niggas is fake, I won't ignore it



I put your boy in the seat

You got your bis' in the streets

I wash my hands when I eat

I don't wanna handle the key

I don't know no one BD

But they dependent' on me

Niggas don't know where I'm at

I find your house on the app

People around you ain't slatt

They plottin' hard when you slatt

They got a gun in your back

This who you trust you sleepin' at night

I look in the mirror I see what I like

It is what it is, I'm right when I'm right

Fuck with my kids, you fuck with your life

You fuckin' these hoes, I'm fuckin' my wife

AK not silent like knife

Think he won't do it, I might

I gotta do what I like

I gotta, that's my word



That's my brother, don't you know it?

[?] from Yoshinoya

Stone Mountain read and the caster cord

This my life, I must enjoy it

This my life, they bus it for it

We don't hold back, we must go forward

Stay where you at, you're supposed to, boy

Niggas is fake, I won't ignore it



This is a code red for old heads

Who never liked my short shorts and [?]

Been a minute since he had to fit it on the notepad

I was busy buildin' up the life that niggas don't have

Told me that money make you lonely, it ain't so bad

Niggas jokes are so dad

They haven't seen their son in a month

Sold some apple stock to buy a farm, I needed to stunt

I told 'em take the back end points, he wanted to front

Now his career's in a blunt

These rappers cosplay, the industry Comic-Con

The industry evil people, me and fam' gotta trauma bond

Drive like the Autobot

Integrity whore, say what I mean

Apologize if I didn't, or clarify

If it's written in stone

Freak it and leave it alone

Give it time, let the truth come to light

Let 'em catch up

Niggas peepin' like, damn, he was right

Rather have my foot on their neck than they hand on the mic'

Rather die a good man with a bad wife

These niggas almost sticked me and they're dressin' like a hype beast

Used to get the peach milkshake and add the eight-piece

White boy throwin' dirt on my name for the faint peace

Checks off, death, murder, and pain, leave you empty

I curse you with that knowledge

Put they hands on a woman for the clout but said I'm wildin'

Death before the sauna

On my mom like Keke Palmer

I'm allergic to the drama, you saw me and Tyler

I'm allergic to this rap shit

Made a song, but spent more time writin' the caption

I'm an actor, you can put that on set

I'm about that action

My tweets all lower case I saw these niggas cappin'

My homegirl said we a stalker, so I ain't dappin'

I ain't see you, man, what happened?

Man, the blog era overtakin' all our stars

My favorite spot was 'bout to close, so I made some calls

Bitch nigga, eat a dick and doggy bag of balls



You've never heard of Chaka Khan?

What are they teaching you in school?"
